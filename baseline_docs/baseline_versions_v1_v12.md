# Baseline framework v1–v12

v1 Core baseline: spend, minutes, calls, CPM, avg call length (monthly)  
v2 Modality: OPI vs VRI breakdowns  
v3 Invoices: invoice totals for reconciliation  
v4 QA: missing essentials, duplicates, outliers  
v5 Dimensions: language (+ dept/location when present)  
v6 Time trends: month-over-month views  
v7 Rate logic: effective rate (CPM) by modality/language  
v8 Mix decomposition: minutes share shifts explain CPM changes  
v9 Benchmark comparison: expected spend vs actual variance  
v10 Scenarios: what-if savings (rate normalization, VRI→OPI shift)  
v11 Confidence scoring: High/Medium/Low with reasons  
v12 Recommendations: ranked opportunity register
